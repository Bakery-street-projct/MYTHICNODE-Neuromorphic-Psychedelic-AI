- Implements psychedelically-inspired modulation mechanisms.

## Biosignal Acquisition
- Real-time EEG/ECG/GSR data ingestion using LSL.
- Features extraction for adaptive modulation.

## GAN Visual Generator
- Hexagonal convolutional GAN producing kaleidoscopic patterns.
- Conditioned on neural states for closed-loop experiments.

## Feedback Control
- PID and MPC algorithms adjust stimuli dynamically.

## User Interface
- React-based dashboard visualizing real-time data streams.

## Deployment
- Kubernetes and Docker for scalable and modular deployment.
